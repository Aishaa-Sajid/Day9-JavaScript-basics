JavaScript Basics: DOM Manipulation & Event Handling (Day 9 of #100DaysofWeb)
Overview
This repository captures my learning progress on Day 9 of the #100DaysofWeb challenge. Today was dedicated to diving into the fundamental concepts of JavaScript, specifically focusing on how JavaScript interacts with and manipulates the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), handles user events, and manages basic data.

This project serves as a foundational exercise to understand how dynamic and interactive behaviors are added to static HTML and CSS pages.

Concepts Explored
DOM Element Selection:
Learning how to select specific HTML elements from the document (e.g., document.querySelector()) to gain programmatic control over them.
DOM Manipulation:
Directly modifying the properties and styles of selected HTML elements using JavaScript (e.g., element.style.propertyName, element.textContent). This demonstrates how JavaScript can dynamically change the visual appearance and content of a webpage.
Event Handling:
Attaching event listeners (e.g., addEventListener()) to HTML elements to respond to user interactions, such as button clicks.
Implementing simple callback functions to execute specific actions when an event occurs (e.g., alert(), console.log()).
Variable Declaration:
Understanding the use of let and const keywords for declaring variables to store different data types (numbers, strings, arrays).
Basic JavaScript Syntax:
Familiarization with core JavaScript syntax for writing executable code.
